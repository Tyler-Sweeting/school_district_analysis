### Summary 

During my analysis there were several findings I made. First, the average budget is higher for public schools than it is for Charter, but the students tend to perform better at charter schools than they do at public schools. I also noticed that students tend to have higher reading scores than math scores. There is also a wide range of student populations at the high school level, several being over 1500 students and a few being under 500 students.
